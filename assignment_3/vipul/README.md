**Approach**

first defined the weights for the data set 
then use the basic condition of SVM and brought down the weights
by testing it for ech data point and desending towards its original value
then getting the final weights 
to the input numbers multiplying the weights finding its classification

**Dataset**

for this i used the toy dataset which is generated by random function
it has two classes each with 50 datapoints

**Model**

here i used the SVM model to fit a hyperplane between the two data set
the things above the hyperplane describes one class and the things below the hyperplane describes the another class

**Results**

on entering the value of 'x1' and 'x2' it gives us the classified value in form of 1 and -1 
the model is accurate with comparison to standarad sklearn for this dataset
but has greater time complexity than the original svm

**Steps to Run**

run the 'predict.py' file
the plot will show the data set and an approx hyperplane 
now enter the value of of 'x1' and 'x2'
the output will show the predicted result by both custom and standarad module
and also it will show the the weights used by the custom  model
